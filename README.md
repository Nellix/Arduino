# Arduino
This project was developed for Fishino's hardware (compatible with Arduino One).
This Arduino's sketch gives us the opportunity to controll :

  - Some statistics such as Temperature,Humidity and so on;
  - We can manage lights of the room by site's interface (ON/OFF) ;
  - We can reset the system via remote;
  
 
The site for the stats is : http://fishinoexample.altervista.org/Fishino/contatti.php
